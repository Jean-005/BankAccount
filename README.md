# BankAccount

I created a Bank Account repo twice. Each time I tried merging the Github repo with my local one, they failed to merge. I kept encountering error messages that I tried to resolve but I think at some point I ended up creating a repo inside of another one. I would have liked to make multiple commits as I did this lab but I was unable to push my code up to Github at any stage. please find below the error messages I encountered:
